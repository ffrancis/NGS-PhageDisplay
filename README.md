# NGS-PhageDisplay
Set of scripts for analyzing phage display NGS data.

1. Seperate (demultiplex) samples from a single fastq file into multiple .csv files.
2. Translate the DNA sequences into protein sequences and further clean the data. 
3. Calculate the signal to noise (S/N) ratio for each sample(experiment).
4. Compare S/N between multiple samples.
5. Calculate the ranking score for the compared data from Step 4.
6. Cluster the sequences and visulaize the result.
